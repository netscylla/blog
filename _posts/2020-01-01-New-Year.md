![New Year](/blog/assets/2020-new-year.png)

We've been very busy at the end of the year (2019). We have moved our offices to London; encouraged our staff to participate in the SANS X-mas Challenge, promoted internal
knowledge sharing and team building.

We would like to thank all our customers and supporters for 2019, without you it would not have been a success. We wish you all a happy 2020 and look forward to working with you again.

After the 13th January watch this space, as we will publish our solution to the SANS X-mas Challenge - we want to give others the opportunity to finish their write-ups first.

Thank you

All the staff at Netscylla
