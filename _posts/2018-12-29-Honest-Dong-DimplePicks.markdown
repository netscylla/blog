# Review
Manufactured by Honest Dong, this is a 10-piece dimple lock pick set, with colorful handle, and durable metal material. 
It also comes with a covert hard case (that resembles a spectacles case) for easy storage and carrying.

The handles are crafted anodised aluminium, which are of a good size that makes them easy to use the rotate without
much effort. Resulting in a comfortable grip and easy movement.

What's Included:
 * 10 x Dimple lock pick set
 * * 1 center flag
 * * 5 left flags
 * * 4 right flags
 * 2 x Turning tool

Unfortunately, these picks lack a professional finish. But this can be easily remedied with some patience, sandpaper and a little
elbow grease. You can round off the square shafts, bevel the flags, and give them a good polish - they will then closely resemble 
a professional kit.

# Good Points
What they have going for them: 
 * Fast & Free shipping; 
 * Large number of different picks;
 * Easy to hold handles;
 * Strong shafts on the picks;
 * Shafts/handles are replaceable with allen key provided
 * All packaged together in a case.

# Bad Points / Room for improvement
What they have against: 
 * Picks are a little on the thick size - might not fit most dimple locks;
 * Square shafts might make the picks hard to rotate in locks;
 * Shafts are not professionally finished (as you might expect?)

# Conclusion
Marketed as a cheap starter kit for dimple lockpicking; Although with a little extra work to polish the picks, 
you can turn this cheap and affordable picking set into a decent set of lockpicks that any professional can be
proud to hold.
