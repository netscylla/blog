# Review
Sparrows lockpicks have a new pick set - specifically targeted at dimple (sometimes referred to as high-security) locks.

Priced at $50 Canadian dollars this is an introductory set aimed at beginners. The Black Flag set consists of seven dimple picks and 9 wrenches all designed for attacking dimple locks. 

Dimple locks are very different than your standard pin tumbler lock and for that reason you do need a specific set of picks to open them. 
The tips have been formed to cover the majority of dimple locks that you will find in the field, and the shafts have been rounded so the picks can rotate precisely in the keyway. 

The handle has a solid steel core that is wrapped in a high durometer Geometric rubber. 
The Geometric shape helps with grip and gives a consistent reference to tip location and position. 
This can be critical when picking dimple locks as it can be easy to lose the position of the tip when it’s in the lock. 

# Good Points
What they have going for them: 
 * Rounded shafts; 
 * Number of tensioners included; 
 * Fast shipping; 
 * Heads are thin for use in most dimple locks;
 * All packaged together in a case.

# Bad Points / Room for improvement
What they have against: 
 * Flags are a little too short; 
 * Curved flags are almost identical to the flat flags; 
 * Shafts are malleable - easily bend;

# Conclusion
This is a good and affordable starter kit! However ....

Although the flags could use a little more finishing, for a new starter in dimple pin picking this is a good introductory set.
For those already proficient in dimple pin picking, or those that already have a dimple picking set, this set is not for you.

# Tips for picking dimple locks
 * When you pick dimple locks you need to sit the pick on the top of your tension bar. 
 * Dimple locks are pretty much like a normal tumbler lock, differences being:
  * * key turns 90 degrees
  * * pins are bigger compared to normal pin tumblers
 * despite warding on both sides of the key, there is usually only one set of pins - this is so the key works in either orientation.
 * It’s usual to rake the dimple lock first, set as many pins as possible using the simplest technique, then single pick the remaining.
